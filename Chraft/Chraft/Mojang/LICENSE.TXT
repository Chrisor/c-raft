The files in this folder and its subfolders are only partially the work of the C#raft development team.
They are heavily based on work by Mojang, AB.  Please, respect that these algorithms represent that hard
work of Notch and other developers at Mojang.  They are not meant to be open source, and should not be
redistributed.  I, Paul Buonopane, use these files in belief that I am not competing with Mojang, but
bettering the Minecraft community and thus increasing profits for Mojang.  I consider this project a thank
you to Mojang for their wonderful product: a compliment to it, not a replacement for it.  These files were
released with that intent in mind.  I cannot imagine why someone would use these files abusively, or even
how, but please, do not be the person to surprise me.

Many thanks goes to the developer of Crafty, who worked quite hard to make these files usable to begin with.
